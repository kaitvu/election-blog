      <description>Introduction Turning the page on election &amp;ldquo;fundamentals,&amp;rdquo; our course now turns to examining presidential campaigns and their impact on voter behavior. Campaigns capture the attention of thousands of voters across the country, helping them learn about political candidates and influence the electoral process.&#xA;My blog this week focuses on the &amp;ldquo;air war&amp;rdquo; between campaigns: advertising has both the power to persuade and mobilize voters to the ballot box. First, I create a series of descriptive figures and tables to assess past trends in campaign ad spending on both the national and state levels.</description>

      <title>Blog 5: Demographics</title>

      <description>Introduction Defined as group level characteristics that can be attached to individuals, campaigns often look to demographics to inform predictions of election outcomes — including the likelihood of candidate support and turnout — and determine which populations to target with their limited resources. As such, demographic conformity is almost an expected norm: individuals are expected to vote in line with their perceived group interests.&#xA;However, are demographics truly predictive of vote choice?</description>

      <title>Blog 4: Incumbency &amp; Expert Predictions</title>
      <link>https://kaitvu.github.io/election-blog/post/2024/09/29/blog-4/</link>

      <description>Introduction Whether it&amp;rsquo;s at the party or candidate level, nearly every forecasting model includes some measure of incumbency. Incumbent politicians are often understood to have an &amp;ldquo;advantage&amp;rdquo; over their challengers: they can harness the &amp;ldquo;bully pulpit&amp;rdquo; to command media attention and shape public opinion, get a head start on campaigning, and utilize the powers of their offices (e.g., control spending) to gain constituent favor. However, how does this so-called advantage fare in the face of an increasingly polarized electorate, questions of blame attribution, and incumbency fatigue?</description>

      <description>Introduction Public opinion polling is essential to understanding democratic discourse: polls measure the will of voters and help to promote election integrity. In this blog, I use both national and state-level polling data to predict election outcomes for the 2024 presidential election.&#xA;Historical Polling Averages (2016-2024) First, I examine overall trends in election-year polling averages. The following visualization contains three plots: the percentage of average poll approval for both the Republican and Democratic candidates are plotted by date for 2016 (March-November), 2020 (March-November), and 2024 (March-September).</description>

      <title>Blog 2: The Economy</title>

      <description>Introduction &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the economy, stupid.&amp;rdquo; Coined by political strategist Jim Carville, the phrase became a hallmark of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s successful election bid against incumbent George H.W. Bush in 1992. Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen note in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists that voters engage in &amp;ldquo;economic voting,&amp;rdquo; through which economic distress — especially during an election year — harms election outcomes for the incumbent. However, to what extent do Americans truly vote based on the state of the economy?</description>

      <description>Introduction In this first blog post, I visualize and analyze historical popular vote data from 1948-2020 to examine the competitiveness of U.S. presidential elections and help inform predictions for the 2024 election. This blog also includes state-level analysis of past two-party popular vote share and looks at changes in battleground states over time.&#xA;Overall Two-Party Vote Share To begin, I will examine how two-party vote share in U.S. presidential elections have changed over time.</description>
